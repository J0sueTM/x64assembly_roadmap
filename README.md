# x64assembly_roadmap

This repository is contains files of my progress while learning a new language: x86_64 assembly. Based on (this repo)[https://github.com/yds12/x64-roadmap].

**Why**

I'm interested in working in low level software development. So, I'm quite sure that knowing assembly, debugging and low level stuff will help me a lot. You can use this repo for learning too :)

**Progress**

Theory

- [X] registers

Code

- [ ] hello world

**Useful resources**

- [linux kernel syscall list](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.13/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl)
